How to Set Up
Frontend: Deploy to Vercel as usual.
Backend:
Push your FastAPI code to GitHub.
Create a new project on Railway/Render/Fly, connect your repo, and deploy.
Set environment variables (REDIS_URL, PG_*, etc.) in the backend host’s dashboard.
Redis:
Sign up at Upstash, create a free Redis database, and copy the REDIS_URL.
Paste this URL into your backend’s environment variables.
Postgres:
Sign up at Supabase or Neon, create a free database, and copy the connection string.
Paste this into your backend’s environment variables.
Why Not Vercel for Backend?
Vercel’s serverless functions are not suitable for FastAPI with background tasks, persistent connections, or stateful services.
Free hosts like Railway/Render/Fly are designed for this and have generous free tiers.
Summary
You can use only free services!
Use Vercel for frontend, Railway/Render/Fly for backend, Upstash for Redis, and Supabase/Neon for Postgres.
All these services have free tiers and are easy to set up.
